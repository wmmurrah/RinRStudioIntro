Rtutorials Overview
========================================================

## What I want to do today
 1. Map the purpose and plan for Rtutorials
 2. Connect this plan to bigger FOCAL mission
 3. Look at at 'mature' project as an example
 4. Talk about our sharable/pedagogical example (STAR)
 5. Talk about working examples for everyone
 

 
## Plan for Rtutorials
### 1. Preparation
   - Import
   - Explore
   - Transform
   - Basic graphics?
   
###  2. Analysis
  - Regression 
  $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 tx_i  + \epsilon_i$$
  - ITT 
  - TOT
  - Psychometric
  - Missing Data Analysis

### 3. Reporting
  - knitr - $\LaTeX$
  - knitr - Rmarkdown
  - Presentations
  - Graphics (more advanced)
  - Tables
  
### 4. Advanced Topics
 - Version control (git)
 - Linux cluster (HPCs)
 - MplusAutomation/Lavaan/SEM in R
 - Bayesian
 
## Connection to FOCAL mission
 - Rtutorials will parallel (or drive) the development of our FOCAL framework
 - Integral to our student development model
 - Builds skills needed to realize our being the experts at Reproducible Research
 - Produces the content of or RR products
 
 
## Look at at 'mature' project as an example

look at Relimport project
 
## Talk about our sharable/pedagogical example (STAR)
look at StackEdit
look at STAR data

## Talk about working examples for everyone

 - everyone picks a small treatment effects project
 - pick outcome of interest, covariates and treatment variable
 - will be used to 'learn by doing'
 - can use wings or other data
 - for for scalable to publishable project (but not a full project)
 - can be something you need to do in the future 
 - can be something you have already done in another program
